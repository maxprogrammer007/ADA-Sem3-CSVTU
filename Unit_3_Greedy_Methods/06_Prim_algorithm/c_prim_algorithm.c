Explanation
Graph Representation: The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix graph[V][V], where V is the number of vertices.

Key and MST Set:

key[] array holds the minimum weight edge for each vertex.
mstSet[] array keeps track of vertices included in the MST.
minKey Function: This function finds the vertex with the minimum key value that hasnâ€™t been included in the MST yet.

Prim's Algorithm Implementation:

The first vertex is initialized with a key value of 0 to start the MST.
The algorithm iteratively picks the minimum key vertex, adds it to the MST, and updates the key values for its adjacent vertices.
Output: The edges included in the MST along with their weights are printed.

Example Output
When you run this program, the output will display the edges included in the Minimum Spanning Tree along with their weights:

Edge     Weight
0 -- 1   2
1 -- 2   3
0 -- 3   6
1 -- 4   5
